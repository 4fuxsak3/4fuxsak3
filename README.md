- ⭐ More About Me, I'm 45 , a little older
 than most people getting into this end 
of the it field. I was technologically
illiterate  12 yes ago, and if it wasn't 
for my wife I probably would have stayed
that way. She was the one who introduced 
me to Linux, it was love at first sight &
Now that my children are grown I'm able to
focus on school more. I'm largely still 
finding my way around the many facets of 
this field, while greedily consuming all
The knowledge I can. (Retaining it takes 
a lot of repetition & practice) And 
although I'm still not clear on what 
I want my focus to be, I feel it will
become apparent in time.
I'm excited to be here on git hub and I'm
looking forwad to building and expanding 
my skill set. Thanks for taking the time 
to learn a little about me, I look forward
to getting to know some of you
