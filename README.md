 in coding , shell scripting as well as 
all areas of infosec/pentesting
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all of the

before that time comes.

- ⭐ More About Me, I'm 45 yrs old. Older
than most people just starting out in the
IT field. Less than 12 yes ago I was 
technologically illiterate. It was
 my wife who first introduced me to Linux,
and it was love at first sight. Now that 
my children are grown I'm able to
focus on school more. I'm largely still 
finding my way around the many facets of 
this field, while greedily consuming all
The knowledge I can. (Retaining it is 
a bit more complicated) And 
although I'm still not clear on what area
I want my focus to be,I'm excited to be
here on git hub and hope to find it while
I continue building and expanding 
my skill set. 
- 👃 Thanks, Thanks for taking the time 
to learn a little about me, I look forward
to getting to know some of you!
